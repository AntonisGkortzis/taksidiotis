## History

* One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Colossus of Rhodes was a statue of the Greek titan-god of the sun Helios, erected in the city of Rhodes, on the Greek island of the same name, by Chares of Lindos in 280 BC. More info here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_of_Rhodes

* Democracy was inherited to the world by ancient Greece and especially Athens where it was developed around the fifth century BC. The longest-lasting democratic leader was Pericles. [click to see more details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy)

* Mathematics and specifically geometry were greatly advanced in ancient Greece. Among the most famous mathematicians are Pythagoras, Euclides and Thales.  [click to see more details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics)

* The name of Athens, connected to the name of its patron goddess Athena, originates from an earlier Pre-Greek language.

* Athens was named according to the Greek mythology from competition that the goddess Athena had with Poseidon about who will become protector of the city. The myth says that Poseidon gave a spring with sea water whilst Athena offered an olive tree as she touched the ground of the sacred rock of the Acropolis. The people of Athens choose Athena as their protector and so the city was named after the goddess of wisdom. The myth is symbolic but the two Gods symbolising the strength of Athens as a city of wisdom and as a sea power. The first settlement of Athens 3000 BC was situated on the rock of Acropolis.

* One of the most commonly used gadgets these days, an alarm clock has its origin in ancient Greece. In due course of time and with the proper sophistication of technology, the alarm clock went through a number of changes from a mechanical alarm to the modern gadgets like cell phone, which come with inbuilt alarm. But the first of alarms used by ancient Greeks were nothing like today. They used to integrate mechanism to time the alarm which would sound off delicate water organs or pebbles into drums.

* The Greeks also are important for the contribution to sports. "Gymnasiums" and "stadiums" today--are names that both come from Greek.  There are lots of other echoes of the Greeks in our sports tradition of today. Some of the universal track and field events (e.g., the javelin and the discus) come out of Greek tradition.  Events like the Marathon and the Decathalon have Greek names, though they weren't specific Greek events. Perhaps the best example of Greek influence on our sports tradition: the Olympic games.

* The marathon event was created for the modern Olympic Games held in Athens. The marathon is a commemoration of the run of the Greek soldier Pheidippides (also known as Philippides), who ran from Marathon to Athens to report the Athenians’ victory against the Persians in 490 B.C.

## Museums/Sightseeing

* Palace of the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes is a medieval castle in the city of Rhodes, on the island of Rhodes in Greece. It is one of the few examples of Gothic architecture in Greece.

## Graffiti

~ Top Places to See Street Art in Athens:

* Pireos - Right next to a busy street, try not to get run over by a car while admiring the panels of street art that line this area. If you’re feeling more adventurous, head to Leonidou and Keramikou Streets and pretty much anywhere in the surrounding area. Once super-sketch and now only mildly sketch, find a lot of great pieces here too.

* Gazi - Not just for nightlife anymore. Come here and around the Technopolis area (an industrial museum and cultural space) to get your fill of culture without all the tourists. Large, government-approved pieces may not be as exciting as undercover art, but everything here is still raw and beautiful.

## Kids-activities

* If you want to spend a creative day with your children, get them to the Attica Zoo Park. Make sure you pick up a map to guide you around the park as it is huge, housing more than 350 animal species of which half are on the endangered list. Kids will love it.
[For more details click here](http://www.atticapark.com/en/)

* The Children's Museum in Plaka, which operates in collaboration with the Municipality of Athens, is very popular with young visitors, who enjoy the exhibits and the possibility to develop their observation skills, learn more about the cultural heritage and understand everyday life through games. Children can play at the shops of the "Market", make their own biscuits at the "Kitchen", journey through time at the "Attic", learn about their body at the exhibit "How do I move?", experiment and play with water and much more. Children under six years love the playroom where they can play with building blocks and visitors of all ages appreciate the toyshop with original toys and handmade objects.

* Allou! Fun Park: The most famous theme park of Athens, located at Rentis. It offers plenty of activities for both kids and, why not, adults! Unfortunately, the only public means of transport that gets you there is bus. [click to see location](https://goo.gl/maps/GAZStSK2NeA2)

## Other tips and tricks

* Greece is a small country, so it is a good idea to travel almost all around the country and not only to one place, since you decided to travel all the way to the southern country of Europe.

* There are many destinations close to Athens where you can make a daily trip, relaxing from the urban noise and air pollution. One of my favorite destinations is Nafplio, a 2-hours drive from Athens, where you can stroll in the peaceful and picturesque streets and also climb the Palamidi fortress and enjoy a breathtaking view! [For more details click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nafplio)

* A day trip in Sounion (2 hours car drive from Athens) is a nice choice for somebody who wants to escape from the capital. The temple of Poseidon and the view from up there worth the visit. [click to see more details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sounion)

* Don't forget your hat and your sunglasses!! Sunscreen is also a must (especially if you are fair-skinned)!

* Never bother lining up at the main entrance of the Acropolis. There’s a back way in that has a tiny line that no one knows about. This back door is faster and more efficient than the main like that every other tourist uses. By using this alternative entrance it will save you an hour of lining up in the blazing sun (should you ignore Vasilis’s tip above).

* Mobile Phone Data is important when you’ve stopped using paper maps. Outside the central subway stations you’ll find people set up selling sim cards with various data packs on offer. While they are looking to sell to locals – as a tourist it’s an absolute bargain for the mouth of data you get plus the ability to book bars and restaurants.

* The Greeks will be more friendly and eager to help if you try to speak some Greek, too. Just a couple of words are fine, they love it when they hear a stranger speaking their language. So, say “kalimera” instead of “good morning” and “efxaristo” instead of “thank you”, and you will see some big proud smiles in their faces.
