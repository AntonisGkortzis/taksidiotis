## Other tips and tricks

* Greece is a small country, so it is a good idea to travel almost all around the country and not only to one place, since you decided to travel all the way to the southern country of Europe.

* There are many destinations close to Athens where you can make a daily trip, relaxing from the urban noise and air pollution. One of my favorite destinations is Nafplio, a 2-hours drive from Athens, where you can stroll in the peaceful and picturesque streets and also climb the Palamidi fortress and enjoy a breathtaking view! [For more details click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nafplio)

* A day trip in Sounion (2 hours car drive from Athens) is a nice choice for somebody who wants to escape from the capital. The temple of Poseidon and the view from up there worth the visit. [click to see more details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sounion)
